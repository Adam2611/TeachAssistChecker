# TeachAssistChecker
TeachAssist is an online platform used by teachers and students for the open communication of marks and other important details. This well-documented Python Script will allow students to link multiple accounts and keep track of all their marks over time. As well, if used with a scheduler program, it can email the student at the moment their mark changes.
